WIP Robot Programming Language
This project is the culmination of my computer systems engineering degree.
The final software will be designed to control a robot vehicle through simple commands.
It will read batch files and translate them into commands that drive the robot.
Additionally, it wil retrieve sensor readings and navigation information from the robot.

Parsing abd tokenization of the language takes place using the python program.
The generated tokens are sent to the robot where they are interpreted and trigger movement commands.


Current Version Features:
Text Editor: Open Edit and Save text files.
GUI: Functioning basic GUI for operation.
Batch File Processing: Convert batch files into commands and send them via serial.

Final Version Features
Command Execution: Execute commands to control the robot's movement and actions.
Sensor Integration: Retrieve sensor readings from the robot for monitoring and analysis.
Syntax: Syntax is explained in a file
