WIP Robot Programming Language
This project is the culmination of my computer systems engineering degree.
The final software will be designed to control a robot vehicle through simple commands.
It will read batch files and translate them into commands that drive the robot.
Additionally, it wil retrieve sensor readings and navigation information from the robot.
