Robot Programming Language
This if my final project for my computer systems engineering degree.
The software is designed to control a robot vehicle through simple commands.
It reads batch files and translates them into commands that drive the robot.
Additionally, it retrieves sensor readings and navigation information from the robot.

Features
Batch File Processing: Convert batch files into commands for robot control.
Command Execution: Execute commands to control the robot's movement and actions.
Sensor Integration: Retrieve sensor readings from the robot for monitoring and analysis.
Navigation Feedback: Obtain navigation information to ensure precise movement and positioning.
