As this is my first project utilising git, these
commands are here for my personal reference.

Pull branch: git pull origin "branch"
Add all files to staging area: git add .
Commit changes to branch: git commit -m “commit title”
Push branch to HUB: git push -u origin "branch"     -f forces push
Change working branch: git checkout "branch"
New branch: git branch "name"
Show working branch: git branch     --Starred is current

Removed cached files from tracking: git rm -r --cached .    -- Re add all once .gitignore is updated

Clone Repository: Git clone “URL”
Reset origin: git remote set-url origin "url"

Merge:
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge test
git push origin master

Delete Remote Branch: git push origin -d "branch"
Delete local branch: git branch -d "branch"
The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been
pushed and merged with the remote branch.
Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted
