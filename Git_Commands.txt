As this is my first project utilising git cli interface, these
commands are here for my personal reference .

Pull branch: git pull origin "branch"
Add all files to staging area: git add .
Commit changes: git commit -m “commit title”
Push to branch: git push -u origin "branch"

Clone Repository: Git clone “URL”
Reset origin: git remote set-url origin "url"
